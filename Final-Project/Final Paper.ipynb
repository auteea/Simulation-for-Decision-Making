    "1. Adding an extra employee.\n",
    "2. Varying employee serving speeds (the idea is that the longer employee works the faster he gets).\n",
    "3. Setting up an extra cart outside the shop with popular flavours.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objectives of the Simulation Study\n",
    "\n",

    "  - Employee shifts and availability.\n",
    "  - Employee processing speeds (time taken to serve each customer).\n",
    "  - Operating hours of the shop.\n",
    "  - Customer arrival rates and patterns (peak and off-peak hours).\n",
    "  - Queue lengths and customer wait times.\n",
    "  - Impact of additional service points (e.g., an extra cart).\n",
    "\n",

    "### Summary of Analysis on Ice Cream Shop Simulation Models\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model 1: Introduction of a Cart with 8 Popular Flavors\n",
    "The simulation results for the model where we introduced a cart with 8 popular flavors were analyzed using statistical tests. The comparison of waiting times between the two systems showed no significant difference (Levene's test p-value: 0.3347, t-test p-value: 0.6081), indicating that the means are not statistically different. However, the queue lengths showed a statistically significant difference (Levene's test p-value: 0.1569, t-test p-value: 0.0162), suggesting that the introduction of the cart significantly reduced queue lengths. The histogram and sorted waiting times further supported these findings, showing a distribution of waiting times around 4 to 5 minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model 2: Addition of One Full-Time Employee\n",
    "In the second model, where one full-time employee was added, the analysis showed statistically significant differences in both waiting times and queue lengths. The comparison of waiting times (Levene's test p-value: 0.0356, t-test p-value: 0.000231) and queue lengths (Levene's test p-value: 0.0345, t-test p-value: 0.001008) between the two systems confirmed that the addition of an employee improved performance metrics significantly. The queue length over time plot showed a notable reduction in queue lengths with the addition of the employee, indicating enhanced service efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the simulation analysis suggests that the introduction of the cart primarily affects queue lengths, while the addition of an employee significantly improves both waiting times and queue lengths, providing a more balanced improvement in the ice cream shop's operational efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model 3: Analysis of Model with Varying Processing Speeds\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this analysis, we evaluated the impact of varying processing speeds on the performance of the ice cream shop model. The processing speeds were set at six different levels: 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60, 66, and 72 seconds per order. The key performance metrics analyzed were average waiting times and queue lengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Data and Results\n",
    "\n",
    "**Waiting Time Analysis**:\n",
    "- **ANOVA Test**:\n",
    "  - F-statistic: 110.73\n",
    "  - p-value: 1.35e-20\n",
    "  - Conclusion: There are significant differences in waiting times across different processing speeds.\n",
    "- **Tukey HSD Test**:\n",
    "  - Significant differences were observed between multiple pairs of processing speeds. Specifically, waiting times significantly increased with higher base processing speeds.\n",
    "- **Box Plot and Tukey HSD Plot**:\n",
    "  - The box plot of waiting times across different processing speeds shows an increasing trend in waiting times as the processing speed increases.\n",
    "  - The Tukey HSD plot confirms the significant differences between specific pairs of processing speeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Queue Length Analysis**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ANOVA Test**:\n",
    "  - Conclusion: Significant differences in queue lengths across different processing speeds were observed.\n",
    "- **Tukey HSD Test**:\n",
    "  - Significant differences in queue lengths were noted between multiple pairs of processing speeds.\n",
    "- **Box Plot and Tukey HSD Plot**:\n",
    "  - The box plot of queue lengths shows that as processing speeds increase, the queue lengths also increase.\n",
    "  - The Tukey HSD plot demonstrates significant differences between specific pairs of processing speeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Regression Analysis**:\n",
    "- **Linear Regression**:\n",
    "  - Coefficient: 0.1785\n",
    "  - R^2 score: 0.4221\n",
    "  - Conclusion: There is a positive linear relationship between processing speed and waiting time, indicating that higher processing speeds lead to longer waiting times.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Impact of Processing Speed on Waiting Time**:\n",
    "- For each second it takes longer to scoop, the average waiting time increases by approximately 0.1785 minutes (about 10.71 seconds). This means that a marginal increase in scooping time can lead to a significant increase in the overall waiting time for customers, highlighting the importance of optimizing the processing speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion and Business Decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis of the three different simulation models provides key insights into the operational efficiency of the ice cream shop:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Introduction of a Cart with 8 Popular Flavors**: This model primarily affects queue lengths, significantly reducing them. However, it does not significantly impact waiting times.\n",
    "2. **Addition of One Full-Time Employee**: Adding an employee significantly improves both waiting times and queue lengths, offering a more balanced improvement in operational efficiency.\n",
    "3. **Varying Processing Speeds**: Higher processing speeds result in increased waiting times and longer queue lengths. Optimizing the processing speed is important for making service more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these findings, business should focus on adding additional staff to improve both waiting times and queue lengths. Additionally, optimizing processing speeds can further enhance service efficiency, minimizing waiting times and improving the overall customer experience.\n"
