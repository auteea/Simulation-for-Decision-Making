# Simulations for Decision Making Course Repository

This repository contains all assignments and the final project for the **Simulation for Decision Making** course.

## Repository Structure

### Assignments
Each folder contains one assignment with its respective code and supporting files.

- **[Assignment 1](Assignments/Assignment1):** Introduction to event-driven simulations using SimPy. The focus is on modeling basic processes and learning how to manage queues and events effectively.
- **[Assignment 2](Assignments/Assignment2):** Advanced usage of the SimPy library, exploring how to handle complex workflows and measure system performance over time.
- **[Assignment 3](Assignments/Assignment3):** Logging and condition events in simulation. This assignment involves using condition-based triggers to simulate real-world scenarios like customer reneging in a queue.
- **[Assignment 4](Assignments/Assignment4):** Focus on condition events and interdependencies. This task builds more advanced simulations, such as waiting for multiple conditions to be met simultaneously.
- **[Assignment 5](Assignments/Assignment5):** Simulation of customer arrivals and queue dynamics. Explores system performance under varying arrival rates and the impact on service times.
- **[Assignment 6](Assignments/Assignment6):** Experimentation with replication and statistical analysis in simulations. The goal is to validate models by running multiple iterations and analyzing the results.
- **[Assignment 7](Assignments/Assignment7):** Scenario-based simulations to test decision-making under uncertain conditions, emphasizing the application of simulations for business or operational planning.

### Final Project
The final project explores various simulation models, including:
- **Employee Speed Simulation:** Examining the impact of employee speed variability on system performance.
- **Extra Cart Simulation:** Investigating how adding extra resources (e.g., carts) impacts throughput and efficiency.
- **Data Distribution Analysis:** Analysis of the overall performance using data visualization and statistical techniques.
