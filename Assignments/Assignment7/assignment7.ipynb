    "We'd like to compare the **average waiting time** of System 1 and System 2 but with Common Random Numbers (CRN). There are several ways of implementing this but today we'll guide you with one of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "When implementing CRN, is important to note the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is never enough to simply use the same seed on the random-number generator(s). \n",
    "- Each random number used in one model for some purpose should be used for the same purpose in the second model—that is, the use of the random numbers must be synchronized. \n",
    "- For example, if the $i$ random number is used to generate the processing time of a machine for the 5th car in model 1, then the $i$ random number should be used for the very same purpose in model 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task 1.1: Create a stream of random numbers for the interarrival times and processing times. Use the same distributions as before, i.e. $exp(1/0.5)$ and $exp(1/0.3)$, respectively. The size of the stream should be at least 1000. Note that this stream must change whenever we set a new seed but must remain the same across system designs**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task 1.2: Modify the `car_generator_crn` to receive this stream of numbers (both, interarrival and processing times) and use them according the counter for each car. Modify also the parts of your code where you're calling this function.**\n",
    "\n",
    "After these first 2 steps. You should have succesfully implemented CRN.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task 1.3: Create the \"replication table\". That is: a table that contains for every replication (<u>and now, for every system design</u>) the average waiting time within replications. This should be very similar to Task 1 of Assignment 6 but considering that now we have two different system designs.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task 1.4: Evaluate whether the difference of average waiting times between the two system designs is statistically significant. You can use a CI or a hypothesis test for this purpose. Recall that when using CRN, we calculate the “synchronized” performance difference for each replication and then we conduct the CI or hypothesis test.

    "We'd like to create a metamodel for analyzing the **average waiting time** of System 1. Suppose that for reducing the waiting time, we can:\n",
    "1. Buy more machines (i.e. increase the number of \"counters\")\n",
    "1. Upgrade the current machines and therefore decrease the processing times by a so-called reduction factor. That is, if the reduction factor ($rf$) is 10% that means that we're decreasing the processing times by 10%. The formula is: $pt_{upgrade} = pt * (1 - rf)$\n",
    "1. A combination of both options.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to understand how our output metric varies when varying this two design variables, we'll use a simple metamodel to approximate the relationship between our design variables and the average waiting time. Recall that we can use Independent Sampling or Common Random Numbers (CRN) when working with metamodels. In this occasion, we'll implement CRN.\n",
    "\n",
    "When implementing CRN, is important to note the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is never enough to simply use the same seed on the random-number generator(s). \n",
    "- Each random number used in one model for some purpose should be used for the same purpose in the second model—that is, the use of the random numbers must be synchronized. \n",
    "- For example, if the $i$ random number is used to generate the processing time of a machine for the 5th car in model 1, then the $i$ random number should be used for the very same purpose in model 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "(If you did Task 1, Task 2.1 and 2.2 are exactly the same as before)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task 2.1: Create a stream of random numbers for the interarrival times and processing times. Use the same distributions as before, i.e. $exp(1/0.5)$ and $exp(1/0.3)$, respectively. The size of the stream should be at least 1000. Note that this stream must change whenever we set a new seed but must remain the same across the design variables**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task 2.2: Modify the `car_generator_crn` to receive this stream of numbers (both, interarrival and processing times) and use them according the counter for each car. Modify also the parts of your code where you're calling this function.**\n",
    "\n",
    "After these first 2 steps. You should have succesfully implemented CRN.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task 2.3: Within the *for* loop for iterate over the replications, nest two more *for* loops for iterate over the number of machines and the reduction factor. In particular, try with a number of machines from 1 to 4 (all integers) and a reduction factor from 0 (no reduction) to 80% with a stepsize of 10%.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that for every seed, for every value of number of machines and for every value of reduction factor, you should run your simulation model. Don't forget to adjust the stream of processing times by the reduction factor and to set the corresponding number of machines when defining the Carwash object.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task 2.4: Modify the `EventLogger_Task2` to set the value of the current number of machines and reduction factor (you can implement this with a new method similar to `set_replication_info`). Include this information everytime you log an event (i.e. in every method that starts with `log_`)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task 2.5: Create the \"replication table\". That is: a table that contains for every replication (<u>and now, for every combination of the design variables</u>) the average waiting time within replications. This should be very similar to Task 1 of Assignment 6 but considering that now we have two design variables.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task 2.6: Aggregate the \"replication table\" accross replications. That is, you should have the average (across replications) of the average (within replications) waiting time for every combination of our design variables.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task 2.7: Fit a (multiple) linear regression using the average (of the average) waiting time as dependent variable and our two design variables as independent variables. Note that the number of machines is a categorical variable and the reduction factor is a numerical variable. You can use any package for this, check Hint 1 for a suggestion.** \n",
    "\n",
    "**Task 2.8: Interpret the results of the (multiple) linear regression and answer the questions.**\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint 1:** An easy way of fitting linear regression models in python is to use the `ols` function of the `statsmodels.formula.api` module. Once you have your fitted model, you only have to use the `.summary()` method on the model to get an overview of the regression results. Check the [reference](https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/example_formulas.html) for more details. Check as well the use of the `C()` operator for treating categorical variables."
